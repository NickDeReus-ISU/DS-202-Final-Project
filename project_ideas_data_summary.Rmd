Research topic (title): Weather and Mortality Analysis

Team members: Madhu Avula, Nick DeReus, Jacob Johnson, Brianna Norman

Data: description of your data set, first data cleaning steps, marginal summaries:

### Data Values and Structure

#### Deaths in 122 US Cities

* Year - 
* WEEK - 
* Week Ending Date - 
* State -
* City -
* Pnemeumonia Deaths -
* All Deaths -
* <1 year (all cause deaths) -
* 1-24 years (all cause deaths) -
* 25-44 years (al lcause deaths) -
* 45-64 years (all cause deaths) -
* 65+ years (all cause deaths) - 

#### NOAA CDO Daily Summaries

  This dataset is quite detailed, but we're mostly interested in three variables:
  
  1. TAVG - Average temperature.
  2. TMAX - Maximum Temperature.
  3. TMIN - Minimum Temperature.

* STATION - Identifying weather station code
* NAME - Weather station name
* DATE - Date of summary
* WT03 - Thunder
* WT04 - Ice pellets, sleet, snow pellets, or small hail"
* PRCP - Precipitation
* WT05 - Hail (may include small hail)
* WSFM - Fastest mile wind speed
* WT06 - Glaze or rime
* WT07 - Dust, volcanic ash, blowing dust, blowing sand, or blowing obstruction
* WT08 - Smoke or haze
* SNWD - Snow depth
* WT09 - Blowing or drifting snow
* WDF1 - Direction of fastest 1-minute wind
* WDF2 - Direction of fastest 2-minute wind
* WDF5 - Direction of fastest 5-second wind
* WT10 - Tornado, waterspout, or funnel cloud"
* PGTM - Peak gust time
* WT11 - High or damaging winds
* TMAX - Maximum temperature
* WT13 - Mist
* FRGT - Top of frozen ground layer
* WSF2 - Fastest 2-minute wind speed
* FMTM - Time of fastest mile or fastest 1-minute wind
* ACMH - Average cloudiness midnight to midnight from manual observations
* WSF5 - Fastest 5-second wind speed
* SNOW - Snowfall
* WDFG - Direction of peak wind gust
* WT14 - Drizzle
* ACSH - Average cloudiness sunrise to sunset from manual observations
* WT15 - Freezing drizzle
* WT16 - Rain (may include freezing rain, drizzle, and freezing drizzle)"
* WT17 - Freezing rain
* WT18 - Snow, snow pellets, snow grains, or ice crystals
* WT19 - Unknown source of precipitation
* WSF1 - Fastest 1-minute wind speed
* AWND - Average wind speed
* WT21 - Ground fog
* WSFG - Peak gust wind speed
* WT22 - Ice fog or freezing fog
* WT01 - Fog, ice fog, or freezing fog (may include heavy fog)
* WESD - Water equivalent of snow on the ground
* WT02 - Heavy fog or heaving freezing fog (not always distinguished from fog)
* PSUN - Daily percent of possible sunshine for the period
* TAVG - Average Temperature.
* TMIN - Minimum temperature
* WDFM - Fastest mile wind direction
* TSUN - Total sunshine for the period

We have two major datasets which will be combined. The first is a morbitity and mortality weekly reports, which is technically a part of influenza tracking reports but it also give general mortality rates. The second is NOAA weather records which records information about climate data specific to certain cities.
The first step in our data cleaning process will be splitting out the records from the influenza mortality rates to pull only the relevant pieces of data. Additionally, we may consider chunking this data into months instead of weeks. From this and the second dataset, we will select around 16-20 individual cities, representing multiple regions within the United States and climate types. From our weather dataset, we will limit the dataset to only the variables we are interested in, including high and low temperatures, as well as flooding and freezing rain. The final step for data cleaning will be combining the datasets based on city and date. 

Questions to be addressed: Fleshed out project idea

The goal of the project is to see the impact of extreme weather on mortality rates considering different climate regions.
We aim to be able to answer these 5 questions:
1. Are there seasonal trends in mortality rates? Do different regions experience these impacts differently?

2. How much of an impact does temperature have on mortality? Do different regions experience these impacts differently?

3. Are different age groups affected differently? What age groups are most at risk?

4. Which kinds of weather events have the greatest impacts on mortality? (Extreme heat, cold, ice, flooding)

5. Define which regions are most affected by certain types of weather? (Which  most vulnerable to heat waves and extreme cold)
