This is Nick trying to put together an example of how to arrange the weather data to compare to the deaths data.

```{r}
mortality <- read.csv("Deaths_in_122_U.S._cities_-_1962-2016._122_Cities_Mortality_Reporting_System_20241019.csv")
bostonWeather <- read_csv("Boston_USW00014739_1962-2016.csv")
```

```{r}
week <- as.Date(cut(bostonWeather$DATE, "week", start.on.monday = FALSE))
weeklyBostonWeather <- aggregate(TAVG ~ week, bostonWeather, mean)

head(weeklyBostonWeather)

```
So we can easily cut the weather data down to weekly aggregates, some will be means while others sums or rates.

I haven't yet combined the two dataframes though that is probably trivial.
