## Introduction

The weather has outstanding impacts on the daily lives of individuals. It is common knowledge that extreme heat and cold as well as precipitation, wind, and storms can be dangerous. We want to take those into account but also attempt to demonstrate more banal long term effects of seasons and weather.

This project seeks to research the weather’s impact on mortality rates
to better understand the necessity and impact of weather resilience as
well as the potential dangers of ongoing climate change.

We shall endeavor to answer the following questions:

1. Are there seasonal trends in mortality rates? Do different regions experience these impacts differently?
2. How much of an impact does temperature have on mortality? Do different regions experience these impacts differently?
3. Are different age groups affected differently? What age groups are most at risk?
4. Which kinds of weather events have the greatest impacts on mortality? (Extreme heat, cold, ice, flooding)
5. Define which regions are most affected by certain types of weather? (Which most vulnerable to heat waves and extreme cold)
6. Do each of the above trends hold when pnumonia deaths (flu seasons) are removed?

```{R, echo = FALSE} 
allData <- read.csv("Data Files/combined_TAVGxMortality_Data.csv") %>% filter(City != 'Utica')
```

## Data

We had to unite multiple datasets to answer these question, one from the
CDC which contains weekly mortality data for a selection of 122 cities
accessed here:
<https://data.cdc.gov/dataset/Deaths-in-122-U-S-cities-1962-2016-122-Cities-Mort/mr8w-325u/about_data>
. The second dataset, accessed here <https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search> contains daily weather summaries from weather
stations from the NOAA, the weather station which best represents
a city from our mortality dataset has to be linked up with their city
and the rest could be dropped.

#### Department of Energy Climate Regions

The US Department of Energy released a map breaking the US into regions at the county level based upon the climate control needs of people in different areas of the nation. Each region is numbered from 1-8, 1 being the hottest and 8 being the coolest. This mapping was selected to help break up the larger dataset by climate region for selection and further comparison.

### Data Preperation

Our multiple datasets had to be combined. Due to constraints with the NOAA data we limited the cities from the 122 in the Mortality dataset to 15 total, 3 from each of the 5 regions from the US Department of Energy map containing the grand majority of the population, regions 2-6.

Region 2
 - Houston, TX
 - Miami, FL
 - Phoenix, AZ
   
Region 3
 - Little Rock, AR
 - Memphis, TN
 - Fresno, CA
   
Region 4
 - Evansville, IN
 - Seattle, WA
 - Wichita, KS
   
Region 5
 - Indianapolis, IN
 - Colorado Springs, CO
 - Boston, MA
   
Region 6
 - Minneapolis, MN
 - Saint Paul, MN
 - Milwaukee, WI
 
These cities then had to be paired up with the weather data, which is tied to specific weather station numbers rather than cities. A table was made up manually containing the information for each city.

| city             | state | station     | region |
|------------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| Houston          | TX    | USW00012918 | 2      |

| Colorado Springs | CO    | USW00093037 | 5      |                                                                                        
| Boston           | MA    | USW00014739 | 5      |                                                                                        
| Minneapolis      | MN    | USW00014922 | 6      |                                                                                        
| Saint Paul       | MN    | USW00014922 | 6      |                                                                                        
| Milwaukee        | WI    | USW00014839 | 6      |                                                                                        

With that prepared, we clean our data:
```
# Imports:
mortality <- read_csv("Deaths_in_122_U.S._cities_-_1962-2016._122_Cities_Mortality_Reporting_System_20241019.csv")
all_station_weather <- read_csv("Station_weather_data.csv")
City_station_numbers <- read_csv("City_station_numbers.csv")

# Clean the table containing the manually entered city station data which contained empty rows
City_station_numbers <- City_station_numbers %>% drop_na(city)

# Rename columns in the weather dataframe
all_station_weather <- all_station_weather %>% rename_at('city', ~'City')
all_station_weather <- all_station_weather %>% rename_at('state', ~'State')

```
Prepare and aggregate weather data, the weather data is daily while the mortality data is weekly.

```
# Expand Date Data
weather_data_prepped <- all_station_weather2 %>% 
 
  mutate( 
    DATE = mdy(DATE),
    Week = week(DATE),
    Month = month(DATE),
    Year = year(DATE),
) %>% 
  
  group_by(STATION, Year, Week)

# Select Values to be Aggregated
TAVG_weekly <- weather_data_prepped %>% 
  
  group_by(region, State, City, STATION, Year, Month, Week) %>%
  
  summarize(
    TAVG = mean(TAVG),
    TMAX_Max = max(TMAX),
    TMAX_Mean = mean(TMAX),
    TMIN_Min = min(TMIN),
    TMIN_Mean = mean(TMIN),
    TSUN = mean(TSUN),
    WSFG_Max = max(WSFG),
    WSFG_Mean = mean(WSFG),
    AWND = mean(AWND),
    PRCP_Mean = mean(PRCP),
    PRCP_Sum = sum(PRCP),
    PRCP_Max = max(PRCP),
    SNOW_Mean = mean(SNOW),
    SNOW_Sum = sum(SNOW),
    SNWD_Mean = mean(SNWD),
    SNWD_Max = mean(SNWD),
  )
```
We then filter and combine our dataframes

```
# Filter the mortality in 122 cities data by city 
mortality_small <- mortality %>% filter(City %in% City_station_numbers$city)

# Merge all_station_weather with city_station_data, adding city and region information to the weather data.
all_station_weather2 <- merge(all_station_weather, mutate(City_station_numbers, STATION = station), by = 'STATION')

# Mutate mortality data, renaming region and adding detailed date information we can use to filter.
mortality_small <- mortality_small %>% mutate(
  Date = mdy(`Week Ending Date`),
  Week = week(Date),
  Month = month(Date),
  Year = year(Date),
) %>% rename_at('REGION', ~'CDC_Region')
```
Finally combine weather and mortality data

```
wm_combined <- merge(mortality_small, TAVG_weekly)
```

### Final Data Shape

### Normalizing Data

There are many circumstances where we must normalize our data because each city in our data set has a different population and different base mortality levels. In order to make them directly comparable we typically find the mean death count for each city for the periods in question then we find changes in mortality as a % change from that mean per city in the periods being studied. In the resulting figures, the mean value appears as 0 and any changes as a percent anomaly from 0.

It isn't a perfect model, but it allows us to demonstrate the relative impact of various factors on the mortality rates of each of our cities and compare them.

## Results

### Basic Observations of from the Dataset
First we explore the general conditions present in our data set, the annual temperature over time as well as seasonal patterns.

#### Average Annual Temperature Over Time

We find that the locations in our data set have seen a progressive increase in average temperatures over the time since the beginning of the time period in 1962. We can't necessarily use this as evidence to support global warming because these locations are all likely subject to strong Heat Island effects, but the experience of people living in these locations is one of increasing average temperature.

While we have data on temperature highs and lows, we focus on mean temperatures because it gives us a more complete look at conditions than either the high or low over the course of a week, which is the length of each of the recorded events in our mortality data set.

```{r}
allData %>% filter(!is.na(`TAVG`)) %>% group_by(Year) %>% summarize(
  Avg = mean(`TAVG`)
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Avg, color = Year) ) + geom_line() + ggtitle('Annual Average Temperature') + scale_color_gradient(low = "pink", high = "darkred" ) + ylab("Average Temperature") + theme(legend.position = "none")
```

When charted by region, we can see that the increase in average temperatures is felt across all climate regions, but is most obvious in Region 6, which is the coolest region.

```{r}
allData %>% filter(!is.na(`TAVG`)) %>% group_by(region, Year) %>% summarize(
  Avg = mean(`TAVG`)
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Avg, color = factor(region)) ) + geom_line() + ggtitle('Annual Average Temperature by Region') + ylab("Average Temperature")
```


#### Seasonality of Temperature
Our data set as a whole saw strong seasonal temperature swings, from an average of about 37 degrees Fahrenheit in January to an average of 78 in July.

```{r}
allData %>% filter(!is.na(`TAVG`)) %>% group_by(Month) %>% summarize(
  Avg = mean(`TAVG`)
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Month %>% factor(), y = Avg, fill = Avg)) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + ggtitle('Average Temperature by Month') + scale_fill_gradient(low = "pink", high = "darkred" ) + ylab("Average Temperature") + xlab("Month") + theme(legend.position = "none")
```

When we explore seasons regionally, we find that region 2 is the warmest year round, but summer temperatures are remarkably similar in all 6 regions, sitting between 73 and 82 degrees in July while winters see a range from 60 in region 2 and 28 in region 6 in January.

```{r}
allData %>% filter(!is.na(`TAVG`)) %>% group_by(region, Month) %>% summarize(
  Avg = mean(`TAVG`)
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Month %>% factor(), y = Avg, fill = Avg)) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + facet_wrap('region') + ggtitle('Average Temperature by Month') + scale_fill_gradient(low = "pink", high = "darkred" ) + ylab("Average Temperature") + xlab("Month") + theme(legend.position = "none")
```

#### Distribution of Daily Average Temperatures

```{r}
allData %>% filter(!is.na(`TAVG`)) %>% group_by(region) %>% ggplot(aes(x = TAVG, )) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = 'darkred', color = 'black') + ggtitle('Average Temperature Histogram') + ylab("Count") + xlab("Average Temperature (F)") + theme(legend.position = "none") 
```

### Seasonal trends in mortality rates

After normalizing death counts across our regions we find that death rates across our sample set are significantly higher on average during the winter season and lower in summer and fall months.

```{r}
# Normalize Deaths
dfStats <- allData %>% group_by(City) %>% filter(!is.na(All.Deaths)) %>% summarize(
  All_Deaths_mm = mean(All.Deaths),
  All_Deaths_msd = sd(All.Deaths),
)

df2 <- merge(allData, dfStats)

df2 %>% group_by(City, Month) %>% 
  reframe(
    deathsZ = (`All.Deaths` - All_Deaths_mm) / All_Deaths_mm
  ) %>% filter(!is.na(deathsZ)) %>% group_by(Month) %>% reframe(
    deathsZ = mean(deathsZ)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes( x = as.factor(Month),
             y = deathsZ,
             fill = deathsZ,
             ) 
         ) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity',) + ylab("% difference from mean deaths") + xlab("Month") + scale_fill_gradient(low = "pink", high = "darkred" ) + theme(legend.position = "none") + ggtitle("Seasonal Effects on Mortality (Normalized)")
```



```{R}
### Create lists of the cities that I'm making observations on
myStatesList <- c('FL', 'CA', 'KS', 'CO')
myCitiesList <- c('Miami', 'Fresno', 'Wichita', 'Colorado Springs')
```

When we break down the data regionally we can see that colder regions have more highly seasonal effects on mortality, but even very warm regions still suffer higher mortality in the winter months.

We hypothesize that there are behavioral factors behind the increased winter mortality, but we aren't able to explore that here. At the very least we can assume that weather cannot be the only, or even the most major, factor behind these findings.

```{R}
### Filter data down to focused cities
### Deaths seem to be higher on average in the Winter Months
### Fresno in Region 3, specifically, saw jumps in mortality November through March each year
### Miami, in Region 2, reported a jump in mortality count between June and July in years 
# myCitiesData <- allData %>%
#   filter(State %in% myStatesList) %>% filter(City %in% myCitiesList)
# 
# monthlyDeathsSummed<- myCitiesData %>%
#   group_by(Month, Year, City) %>%
#   summarise(total = sum(All.Deaths))
# 
# ggplot(monthlyDeathsSummed, aes(x=Month, y=total, color=City)) + 
#   geom_point() + 
#   facet_wrap(~Year, scales="free_x") +
#   labs(
#     title = "Total Deaths by Month",
#     x = "Month",
#     y = "Total Deaths"
#   )

df2 %>% group_by(region, City, Month) %>% 
  reframe(
    deathsZ = (`All.Deaths` - All_Deaths_mm) / All_Deaths_mm
  ) %>% filter(!is.na(deathsZ)) %>% group_by(region, Month) %>% reframe(
    deathsZ = mean(deathsZ)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes( x = as.factor(Month),
             y = deathsZ,
             fill = deathsZ,
             ) 
         ) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity',) + ylab("% difference from mean deaths") + xlab("Month") + scale_fill_gradient(low = "pink", high = "darkred" ) + facet_wrap(~region) + theme(legend.position = "none") + ggtitle("Regional Seasonal Effects on Mortality (Normalized)")
```

### Correlation between temperature and Mortality 

```{R}
ourStatesList <- c('FL', 'CA', 'KS', 'CO', 'TX', 'TN', 'WA', 'IN', 'AZ', 'AR', 'IN', 'MA', 'MN', 'WI')
ourCitiesList <- c('Miami', 'Fresno', 'Wichita', 'Colorado Springs', 'Pheonix', 'Little Rock', 'Evansville', 'Boston', 'Houston', 'Memphis', 'Seattle', 'Indianapolis', 'Minneapolis', 'Saint Paul', 'Milwaukee')

ourCitiesData <- allData %>%
  filter(State %in% ourStatesList) %>% filter(City %in% ourCitiesList)
```
The most deaths occurred during times where the average minimum temperature was between 45 and 60, which is likely the minimum from the days with high maximum temperatures. It is expected that colder regions will see higher mortality counts in lower temperatures when observed outside of the other regions.
#### Plot of the mean of the minimum monthly temperature plotted against the total deaths occurring at those temperatures
```{R}
ggplot(ourCitiesData, aes(x=TMIN_Mean, weight=All.Deaths)) + geom_histogram(bins = 15, fill = 'darkred', color = 'black') + ggtitle('Deaths by Min Temperature Histogram') + ylab("Count") + xlab("Average Temperature (F)") + theme(legend.position = "none") 

```
Region 2 sees the highest death counts at maximum temperatures near 90, with death counts sharply increasing as the max temperature approaches that value. This region's mortality rates do not seem as affected by temperatures below 35, likely due to a generally higher climate and not seeing temperatures that low.
Region 6 confirms the earlier held suspicion of a colder climate holding a higher mortality rate at lower temperatures than that of higher climates. This region has two mortality rate spikes: One where the max temperature approaches 75, and another where it is close to 30. However, the mortality rate seems to be fairly consistent at minimum temperatures between 35 and 60 in region 6


```{R}
ggplot(ourCitiesData, aes(x=TAVG, weight=All.Deaths)) + geom_histogram(bins = 15, fill = 'darkred', color = 'black') + ggtitle('Deaths by Average Temperature Histogram') + ylab("Count") + xlab("Average Temperature (F)") + theme(legend.position = "none")  + facet_wrap(~region)

### Differences in effects by age group
- **Key Findings**:
  - The **65+ years** age group accounts for the highest percentage of total deaths, contributing over 60% of mortality.
  - The **45–64 years** age group is the second most affected, with a significant but smaller share.
  - Younger age groups, including **<1 year**, **1–24 years**, and **25–44 years**, have considerably lower mortality percentages.
- **Conclusion**:
  - Older adults (**65+ years**) are the most vulnerable group, indicating a need for targeted health interventions.
  - The **45–64 years** group also requires attention, but with lower priority compared to seniors.
  
```{r}
# Summarize total deaths by age group
age_groups <- c("X.1.year..all.cause.deaths.", "X1.24.years..all.cause.deaths.",
                "X25.44.years", "X45.64.years..all.cause.deaths.", "X65..years..all.cause.deaths.")
total_deaths <- colSums(allData[, age_groups], na.rm = TRUE)

# Calculate percentages
percent_deaths <- total_deaths / sum(total_deaths) * 100

# Plot the data
barplot(percent_deaths, names.arg = c("<1 year", "1-24 years", "25-44 years", "45-64 years", "65+ years"),
        main = "Mortality Distribution by Age Group", ylab = "Percentage of Total Deaths")
```

### Effects of Seasonality by Age Group

For this section we normalize the data by breaking it up by city and age group, finding the mean mortality rate of each age group in each city and then finding the average deviation from that mean as a proportion. In this way we can demonstrate the differences in strength of seasonal signals on the mortality in each age group.

We show that older age groups are the more highly impacted by seasonal signals, seeing greatly increased mortality rates in the winter compared to the summer months. This increase in mortality could be due to cold weather stressing the body, accidents related to winter weather, seasonal respiratory illness, reduced sunlight and increased sedentary and indoor living, or other changes in seasonal behavior. Later on, we explore the effects of extreme heat and cold on mortality.

Interestingly, young people between the ages of 1 and 24 see the opposite trend as all older age groups. Their greatest mortality rates occur during the three summer months, which correlates well with school scheduling. We hypothesize that this increase is due mostly due to accidents while student age people are out of school and unsupervised, but that is beyond the scope of this paper.

We would also like to point out that in the regional breakdown, this increase in mortality for young people is much weaker in region 2 than the others.

```{r}
# Summarize total deaths by age group
age_groups <- c("X.1.year..all.cause.deaths.", "X1.24.years..all.cause.deaths.",
                "X25.44.years", "X45.64.years..all.cause.deaths.", "X65..years..all.cause.deaths.")

allData %>% filter(!is.na(`All.Deaths`)) %>% group_by(City, Month) %>% pivot_longer(
  cols = age_groups,

#### Heat Waves and Extreme Cold Events
For this section we compare the impact of individual events against the average (expected) morality for the time of the event. To do this we group all events by city and week, find the mean mortality across the years of the data set for each week. Then we define heat wave and extreme cold conditions, weeks with an Average Temperature at or above 85 degrees and weeks with an average temperature at or below 20 degrees and tag such events. We then find the deviation from the mean as a proportion for each such event by city. The figures below are the means of these deviations.

We show that despite increased general mortality in the winter and reduced general mortality in the summer, that Heat Waves are strongly associated with an increase from mean mortality while extreme cold is associated with a decrease.
```{r}
# Mark entries by normal or extreme weather condition
allData %>% filter(!is.na(TAVG)) %>% group_by(City, Year, Week) %>% mutate(
  TempCondition = if(TAVG >= 85) {"Heat+"} else if (TAVG <= 20) {"Cold+"} else {'normal'},
) %>% 
  
  # Find the average (expected) mortality for each week number in each city.
  group_by(City, Week) %>% filter(!is.na(`All.Deaths`)) %>% 
  mutate(
    mean_deaths = mean(`All.Deaths`, na.rm = TRUE),
) %>% 
  # Find the average percent difference in mortality for extreme conditions compared to expected mortality.
  group_by(City, Year, Week) %>% 
  mutate(
    normalized = (`All.Deaths` - mean_deaths) / mean_deaths
    ) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(normalized)) %>% group_by(TempCondition) %>% reframe(
  normalized = mean(normalized, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% ggplot(aes(x = TempCondition, y = normalized, fill = TempCondition)) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge') + scale_fill_manual(values = c("Cold+" = 'skyblue', "Heat+" = 'orangered', 'normal' = 'grey')) + theme(legend.position = "none")
```

) %>% 
  
  # Find the average (expected) mortality for each week number in each city.
  group_by(City, Week) %>% 
  mutate(
    mean_deaths = mean(`All.Deaths`, na.rm = TRUE),
) %>% 
  # Find the average percent difference in mortality for extreme conditions compared to expected mortality.
  group_by(City, Year, Week) %>%

    ) %>%

```

- **Key Findings**:
  - **Heat Waves** are associated with a 3.45% increase in mortality average
  - In total **Extreme Cold** average deaths is lower by around **22%** difference
  - The cities in **Region 2** have no extreme cold events
  - The cities in **Region 6** have no extreme heat events

  All_Deaths_mm = mean(All.Deaths, na.rm = TRUE),
  All_Deaths_msd = mean(All.Deaths - Pneumonia.and.Influenza.Deaths, na.rm = TRUE),
)

df2 <- merge(allData, dfStats)

df2 <- df2 %>% group_by(City, Month) %>% 
  reframe(
    deathsZ = (`All.Deaths` - All_Deaths_mm) / All_Deaths_mm,
    deathsNoF = ( (`All.Deaths` - Pneumonia.and.Influenza.Deaths) - All_Deaths_msd) / All_Deaths_msd
  ) %>% filter(!is.na(deathsZ)) %>% group_by(Month) %>% reframe(

    deathsNoF = mean(deathsNoF, na.rm = TRUE)

  df2 %>% ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(Month), y = Anomaly, fill = type)) + 
  geom_bar( stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge') +

    ylab("% difference from mean deaths") + xlab("Month") + ggtitle("Controlling for Flu Season") + scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("Controlled for Flu", "Base Mortality"))
```

- **Key Findings**:
  - The total number of deaths ranges from **400,000-350,000** deaths a month
  - The total number of pneumonia & influenza deaths range from **30,000-16,000**
  - Controling for flu season doesn't significantly alter the seasonality of mortality. 

- **Conclusion for #6**:
  - The amount of pneumonia & influenza deaths varies between age groups but the
    overall variation between the two charts is minimal and still shows similar seasonal trends.

## Conclusions

Our findings support the idea that weather and seasons have a significant impact on general mortality, with mortality rates trending higher in the winter and lower in the summer for most age groups and correlating well with temperature. However, we found that the warmest areas in our data set experienced similar seasonal trends as colder regions so much of the seasonal signal may be strictly due to changes in human activities throughout the year. It should be stated that many of these changes in activity are or were themselves informed by the weather.

When investigating extreme weather events, we found that heat waves were associated with higher than average mortality while extreme cold was associated with lower than average mortality, which suggests that while winter weather is generally stressful for the population, more extreme cold by itself does not currently contribute to increasing mortality, possibly because people tend to take reasonable steps to protect themselves during cold events. On the other hand, while summer heat is associated with lower levels of general mortality, extreme heat was associated with above average mortality.

We also found that pneumonia and respiratory illness does not have a large impact on the seasonality of deaths, despite making up a notable proportion of all deaths.
